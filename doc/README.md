# Project 5: Abandoned Patent Analysis of USPTO

### Doc folder

The lifetime of a patent is 20 years, but many patents get abandoned before completing this duration. This is in part due to the high maintenance fee required by United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), lack of demand for licensing, limited scope for workability in dynamic market situation or deficit of investment in taking it forward. We have created a knowledge repository of abandoned patents in USPTO which are available for use by the scholars, entrepreneurs and others in the society. In this paper we have analyzed some trends in the rate of abandonment over the years vis a vis non-abandoned patents over the years.

This app is primarily targeted at researchers and scientists who want to use the technology. Patents which have been abandoned are essentially free for use for everyone. Instead of re-inventing the wheel or not-inventing at all, these free technologies can be used by the innovators to take their work forward. This work will primarily benifit small innovators and entrepreneurs as they will have a huge open source and free data available for their use.
