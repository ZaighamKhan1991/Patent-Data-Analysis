The lifetime of a patent is 20 years, but many patents get abandoned before completing this duration. This is in part due to the high maintenance fee required by United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), lack of demand for licensing, limited scope for workability in dynamic market situation or deficit of investment in taking it forward.  We have created a knowledge repository of abandoned patents in USPTO which are available for use by the scholars, entrepreneurs and others in the society. In this paper we have analyzed some trends in the rate of abandonment over the years vis a vis non-abandoned patents over the years.

## Project Title: Abandoned Patent Analysis of USPTO
Term: Spring 2022

+ Team #6

+ **Project title**: Abandoned Patent Analysis of USPTO

+ **Data Collection**: This app uses the data provided by USPTO. USPTO provides data about all its patent on this website https://patentsview.org/download/data-download-tables. However, it does not provide the information about whether or not a patent is abandoned. This information was extracted from Patent Examination System https://ped.uspto.gov/peds/#!/#%2Fsearch. The data was matched through the patent numbers. For the purpose of this project, summaries of the abandoned patent data has been used.

+ **Project summary**: This app is primarily targeted at researchers and scientists who want to use the technology. Patents which have been abandoned are essentially free for use for everyone. Instead of re-inventing the wheel or not-inventing at all, these free technologies can be used by the innovators to take their work forward. This work will primarily benifit small innovators and entrepreneurs as they will have a huge open source and free data available for their use.
