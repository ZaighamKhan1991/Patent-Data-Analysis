Each controller has a configuration manager which stores the controller number of a switch-destination controller to allow automatic volume take-over and automatic control by the original controller.",UNITED STATES,UNITED STATES

Techniques for reducing these currents are presented. In a first aspect, the number of cells being simultaneously programmed on a word line is reduced. In a non-volatile memory where an array of memory cells is composed of a number of units, and the units are combined into planes that share common word lines, the simultaneous programming of units within the same plane is avoided. Multiple units may be programmed in parallel, but these are arranged to be in separate planes. This is done by selecting the number of units to be programmed in parallel and their order such that all the units programmed together are from distinct planes, by comparing the units to be programmed to see if any are from the same plane, or a combination of these. In a second, complementary aspect, the rate at which the voltage levels on the bit lines are changed is adjustable. By monitoring the frequency of disturbs, or based upon the device's application, the rate at which the bit line drivers change the bit line voltage can be adjusted. This can be implemented by setting the rate externally, or by the controller based upon device performance and the amount of data error being generated.",UNITED STATES,UNITED STATES

When the engine load is relatively low, a fuel pressure lowering procedure is executed for lowering the pressure of fuel supplied to the direct injector. An ECU sets a fuel injection ratio, which is the ratio between the fuel injection amount of the direct injector and that of the intake passage injector, based on the engine operation state. The ECU changes the fuel injection ratio such that the ratio of the fuel injection amount of the direct injector to the total amount of the fuel fed to a combustion chamber is decreased, until the pressure of the fuel supplied to the direct injector is raised from the value lowered through the fuel pressure lowering procedure to a predetermined permissible value. This effectively suppresses hampering of the engine combustion, caused by the lowered fuel pressure.",UNITED STATES,UNITED STATES

If the voltage regulator circuits are separated from the output capacitor and brought to separate contacts in the connector, only connecting together on the load side, the voltage regulator will be much better able to overcome the connector impedance. The connector may be a printed connector, in which the metal surfaces of the internal layers of a multilayer printed circuit card are extended successively and mate with a similar complementary printed connector. To overcome high frequency effects, the power bus is a multilayer interleaved bus. Vias conduct the high frequency component of the current much more effectively at the edge of a stack of foil layers, so the power bus is strongly digitated to increase the periphery.",UNITED STATES,UNITED STATES

The sudden deformation serves as a signal to the operator to stop being a gorilla. That leaves the problem of re-shaping the rod. A preferred solution is to use as the rod a Nitinol superelastic metal wire that automatically returns to its previous shape once the force causing deformation is removed.

Ventilatory response is estimated based on detected values of actual heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation, right ventricular O2, stroke volume, tidal volume, and respiration rate. Heart rate reserve values are derived from the actual heart rate along with patient age and rest heart rate. The predicted heart rates, which represent the heart rates the patient would achieve if healthy, are derived from activity sensor signals. The CHF mortality risk metric is then calculated as a ratio of ventilatory response and the slope of the heart rate reserve. If the CHF mortality risk metric exceeds a critical threshold value, such as 90, the warning signal is generated. Also described herein are various techniques for estimating ventilatory response.",UNITED STATES,UNITED STATES
